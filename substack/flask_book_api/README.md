# RESTful API with Flask and SQLAlchemy

This project is a RESTful API built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It aims to provide a robust and scalable API for managing and interacting with a database of [specific entities, e.g., users, products, orders]. The main functionalities of this API include creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database, along with additional operations that might be specific to the application's needs.

## Detailed Descriptions

### app.py
- This script is the main application file. It initializes the Flask application, sets up the routes, and defines the logic for handling requests and responses.

### styles.css
- This CSS file provides the styling for the HTML responses generated by the Flask application. It ensures a consistent and visually appealing layout for the API documentation or any web-based interfaces.


### requirements.txt
- This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the Flask application. It ensures that all necessary packages are installed with the correct versions.
