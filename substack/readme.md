# Substack
This repository contains a collection of Python projects featured in articles on my Substack website, [PFKimmerle Substack](https://pfkimmerle.substack.com/). 


## Repository Structure
This folder contains individual Python projects demonstrating specific functionalities and applications.

### Projects

1. **Weather App**
   - Fetches weather information for a specified city or zip code. Displays the weather data in a simple text format and handles HTTP errors and other exceptions gracefully.

2. **Web Scraper**
   - Sets up a Selenium WebDriver for browsing and extracts data from the BBC News website using BeautifulSoup. Saves the extracted articles to a CSV file and handles errors effectively.

3. **Calculator**
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Continuously prompts the user for operations and handles invalid input gracefully.

4. **Number Guess**
   - Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess. Provides feedback on guesses and tracks the number of attempts taken by the user.

5. **To-Do List**
   - Allows users to add, remove, and view tasks in their to-do list. Ensures tasks are managed gracefully and handles invalid input.

6. **Flask_Book_Api**
   - A RESTful API built using Flask and SQLAlchemy for managing a database of specific entities. Includes functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

7. **Temperature_Converter**
   - Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Demonstrates basic input/output operations and error handling.

8. **PythonStudyGuide**
   - Contains resources to help recognize, write, and debug Python code. Referenced in the article "Recognizing Python: Writing and Debugging Code".
