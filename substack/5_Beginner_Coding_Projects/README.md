# Substack Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python projects, each demonstrating fundamental concepts and basic functionalities. These projects are designed to provide simple yet practical examples of Python programming. For a detailed discussion of these projects, check out my article: ["5 Beginner Coding Projects to Boost Your Skills"](https://pfkimmerle.substack.com/p/5-beginner-coding-projects-to-boost). 


## Repository Structure
This folder contains individual Python projects demonstrating specific functionalities and applications.

### Projects

1. **Weather App**
   - Fetches weather information for a specified city or zip code.
   - Displays the weather data in a simple text format.
   - Handles HTTP errors and other exceptions gracefully.

2. **Web Scraper**
   - Sets up a Selenium WebDriver for browsing.
   - Extracts and parses data from the BBC News website using BeautifulSoup.
   - Finds and processes JSON data embedded in the webpage.
   - Parses article information (title, URL, description, image URL, topics) from the JSON data.
   - Saves the extracted articles to a CSV file.
   - Handles errors and ensures the WebDriver is properly closed after execution.

3. **Calculator**
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Allows the user to input the desired operation and two numbers.
   - Continuously prompts the user for operations until they choose to quit.
   - Validates user input and handles invalid operations or non-numeric input gracefully.
   - Provides feedback for division by zero errors.

4. **Number Guess**
   - Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.
   - Continuously prompts the user to guess the number, providing feedback whether the guess is too high or too low.
   - Tracks the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number.
   - Handles invalid input by prompting the user to enter a valid integer.

5. **To-Do List**
   - Allows users to add new tasks to their to-do list.
   - Displays the current list of tasks with numbered indexing.
   - Provides functionality to remove tasks by specifying the task number.
   - Continuously prompts the user to add, remove, view tasks, or quit the application.
   - Handles invalid input and ensures tasks cannot be empty or invalid task numbers are managed gracefully.
