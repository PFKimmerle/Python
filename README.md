# Python Project Repository

This repository is designed to showcase a variety of Python projects ranging from simple fundamental programming exercises to more complex games and modular coding practices. Each subfolder contains distinct projects or sets of Python scripts aimed at different aspects of learning and applying Python programming.

## Repository Structure

### [Fundamentals]

The `Fundamentals` folder contains basic to intermediate Python scripts and learning materials. It is ideal for those beginning their Python journey or looking to solidify their understanding of fundamental concepts. This includes topics like object-oriented programming, working with data structures, and basic script executions.

**Subdirectories:**
- **[Adventure Companions]**: Demonstrates OOP through a simulation of adventurers and their companions.
- **[Games]**: Contains two games, "Fantasy Duel" and "Elemental Showdown," illustrating game development basics.
- **[Modular Practice]**: Focuses on Python modules, namespaces, and the `__name__` variable.
- **[Misc]**: Includes additional practice materials and examples to enhance understanding of Python concepts.

### [Games]

This folder houses interactive Python games, such as "Fantasy Duel" and "Elemental Showdown," showcasing how Python can be used for game development with OOP principles and engaging gameplay mechanics.

### [Modular Practice]

Here, you will find projects that emphasize the use of modules, improving code readability and maintainability. It's a great resource for understanding how different parts of a Python program interact with each other through imports and modules.

### [Misc]

The `Misc` folder contains various additional scripts and exercises aimed at further exploring and practicing Python. It includes subfolders like Linked List, Store and Products, and Zoo, each focused on specific aspects or implementations in Python.

### [Flask]

The `Flask` folder contains Flask-based web applications, demonstrating how Python can be used for web development.

**Subdirectories:**

- **[Guess_the_Number_Game]**: A beginner-level Flask application where players guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.
  - **app.py**: The main Flask application file.
  - **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS.
  - **templates/**: Contains HTML template files.
    - **index.html**: The main page where users can enter their guesses.
    - **result.html**: Displays the result of the guess and provides feedback.
    - **leaderboard.html**: Shows the leaderboard with names and attempts.
  - **README.md**: Detailed description, setup, and usage instructions for the Guess the Number game.

- **[Counter]**: A simple web application designed to track the number of times a user has visited the site.
  - **app.py**: Initializes the Flask application and sets up session management. Defines routes to display the counter, increment it by 2, reset it, and increment by a custom value.
  - **templates/**: Contains HTML template files.
    - **index.html**: Provides the user interface for the counter application, displays visit count, counter value, and includes forms for incrementing and resetting.
  - **static/**: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
    - **styles.css**: Defines styles for the HTML elements, creating a visually appealing user interface.
  - **README.md**: Detailed description, setup, and usage instructions for the Counter application.


### [Substack]

The `Substack` folder contains a collection of Python projects shared through your Substack articles, demonstrating fundamental concepts and basic functionalities. This repository is part of the article posted on your [Substack](https://pfkimmerle.substack.com/).

**Subdirectories:**

- **[5_Beginner_Coding_Projects]**: Projects aimed at beginners to help them get started with Python programming.
  - **README.md**: Overview and details for each of the five beginner coding projects.
