# Python Fundamentals

This folder within the larger Python project is dedicated to fundamental programming concepts using Python. It contains various scripts and supporting materials that introduce and explain basic to intermediate Python features, ideal for learners looking to solidify their understanding of the language.

## Contents Overview

### Python Scripts

- **bank_account_class.py** - Demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles through a simple bank account class.
- **chaining_methods.py** - Shows how to chain methods in a class for more fluid code.
- **for_loop_basic.py** - Provides a basic example of using for loops in Python.
- **functions_basic_i.py** - Introduces function definitions and calls.
- **functions_basic_ii.py** - Continues with more examples on functions, focusing on different types of arguments.
- **nested_dictionaries_and_lists.py** - Explores how to manage and access nested data structures.
- **python_test.py** - Contains sample code for general Python testing.
- **recognize_python.py** - A simple script to demonstrate recognizing and handling Python syntax and structures.
- **user_class.py** - A class definition for a generic user, illustrating the application of OOP concepts.
- **users_with_bank_accounts.py** - Combines user and bank account classes to simulate a simple system.

### Supporting Materials

- **bank_account_class_screencapture.jpg** - A screenshot showing the output of the `bank_account_class.py` script.
- **chain_methods_screencapture.jpg** - A screenshot demonstrating the output from `chaining_methods.py`.
- **python_test_screencapture.jpg** - A screenshot of tests being run using `python_test.py`.

### Miscellaneous

- **recognize_python.txt** - Contains textual information or notes related to the `recognize_python.py` script.

## How to Use

To use the scripts:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 'https://github.com/PFKimmerle/Python.git'
2. Navigate to the `fundamentals` directory.
3. Run any script by typing `python <script_name>.py` in your terminal (replace `<script_name>` with the actual script filename).

Feel free to explore these scripts to understand Python's capabilities better and how various programming concepts are applied.
