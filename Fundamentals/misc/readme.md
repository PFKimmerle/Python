# Miscellaneous Projects in Python Fundamentals

This directory, `misc`, contains several smaller projects and scripts that demonstrate different aspects of Python programming, focusing on fundamentals and object-oriented programming. Here is a summary of each sub-directory and script:

## Directory Contents

1. **Linked Lists**
   - **Purpose**: Implementations of both singly and doubly linked lists.
   - **Details**: Each type of linked list has its own Python script. Doubly linked lists allow navigation forwards and backwards through nodes.
   - **Location**: `linked_list/`

2. **Store and Products**
   - **Purpose**: Simulates a store management system where products can be added, prices adjusted for inflation, and discounts applied on clearance.
   - **Details**: Object-oriented design patterns are used to manage products and store operations.
   - **Location**: `store_and_products/`
   - **Read More**: Each sub-directory contains its own `README.md` with more details.

3. **Zoo Management System**
   - **Purpose**: Manages a zoo with various types of animals, demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in OOP.
   - **Details**: Includes classes for different animal types and a zoo class that manages them.
   - **Location**: `zoo/`
   - **Read More**: Each sub-directory contains its own `README.md` with more details.

4. **Math Center (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a basic script demonstrating the implementation of a simple math-related utility.
   - **Details**: `math_center.py` is a standalone Python script not placed in a sub-directory due to its simplicity.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python math_center.py` to see its functionality.

5. **Insertion Sort (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
   - **Details**: `insertion_sort.py` is a standalone Python script demonstrating the insertion sort algorithm.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python insertion_sort.py` to see its functionality.

6. **Intro to Test-Driven Development (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD) with examples.
   - **Details**: `intro_to_test_driven_development.py` is a standalone Python script demonstrating TDD.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python intro_to_test_driven_development.py` to see its functionality.

7. **Math Operation (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Various mathematical operations and functions.
   - **Details**: `math_operation.py` is a standalone Python script demonstrating basic math operations.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python math_operation.py` to see its functionality.

8. **Selection Sort (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
   - **Details**: `selection_sort.py` is a standalone Python script demonstrating the selection sort algorithm.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python selection_sort.py` to see its functionality.

9. **Underscore (Single Script)**
   - **Purpose**: Utility functions inspired by Underscore.js library.
   - **Details**: `underscore.py` is a standalone Python script providing utility functions.
   - **Usage**: Run directly with `python underscore.py` to see its functionality.


## How to Use

To run the projects and scripts in this directory:

1. **Navigate to the Sub-directory**: Each sub-project is contained in its own folder. Enter the folder that contains the project you are interested in.

2. **Read the README**: For detailed instructions, each project's folder contains a `README.md` file with specific setup and usage instructions.
Smaller or single file projects maynot have a readme.

3. **Execute Scripts**: 'python <script_name>.py' Replace <script_name> with the actual name of the script you want to run. This command needs to be executed from within the project's directory.

Example:
To run a script from the zoo project, open terminal:
cd zoo
python zoo.py
