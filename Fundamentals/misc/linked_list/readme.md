# Linked List Project

This project provides implementations of both singly and doubly linked lists in Python. It aims to demonstrate the fundamental operations on linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversing the list.

## Structure

- `singly_linked_lists.py`: Contains the implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations.
- `doubly_linked_lists.py`: Includes the implementation of a doubly linked list, offering more flexibility with backward traversal compared to a singly linked list.

## Features

### Singly Linked List
- **Insertion**: Add elements at the beginning, end, or any given index.
- **Deletion**: Remove elements by value or by index.
- **Search**: Find an element in the list.
- **Traversal**: Iterate over the list to display its contents.

### Doubly Linked List
- **Insertion**: Similar to singly linked lists but allows for insertion before or after a given node.
- **Deletion**: Nodes can be removed more efficiently by using the backward links.
- **Search**: Enhanced search capability using both forward and backward traversal.
- **Traversal**: Both forward and backward traversal are supported to display the list contents.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `misc/linked_list` directory.
3. Run the script using Python. For example: 'python singly_linked_lists.py' or 'python doubly_linked_lists.py'
