# Store and Products

## Project Overview

This Python project is an exercise in object-oriented programming, focusing on creating classes, managing associations between them, and practicing modular code organization. The project includes a `Store` class and a `Product` class, each equipped with several methods that mimic the functionality of a simple retail system.

### Features

- **Store Management**: Add products to a store's inventory and remove them upon sale.
- **Product Management**: Update product prices based on inflation or clearance sales.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust product prices with specified percent changes either upwards (inflation) or downwards (clearance).

## File Structure

- `product.py`: Contains the `Product` class with methods for price updates and information display.
- `store.py`: Contains the `Store` class with methods to add and remove products, and to adjust prices store-wide.
- `main.py`: Main executable script that demonstrates the functionalities of the `Store` and `Product` classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was built using Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with any Python 3.x version.

### Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
No external libraries are required to run the project.
2. To run the project, navigate to the project directory and execute the 'main.py' file.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will automatically create a store, add several products, and perform operations like applying inflation and clearance discounts. Product information will be printed to the console.
